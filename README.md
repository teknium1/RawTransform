## Overview

RawTransform is a repository designed to collect and maintain a diverse set of prompts and Python code that can be used to transform raw text snippets into various other forms. This includes, but is not limited to, articles, text book sections, research papers, and other forms of text content. The main aim of RawTransform is to convert such raw data into new, dynamic forms such as Questions & Answers (Q&A), Instructions, Conversations, and more.

## Getting Started

To begin using the RawTransform resources, clone this repository using the following command in your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Teknium1/RawTransform.git
```

## Usage

RawTransform serves as a robust toolset to aid in the transformation of raw text data into other formats. These transformations can be applied to a variety of use cases such as generating study guides, creating dialogues for chatbots, producing FAQs from product documentation, and much more.

The repository is divided into two main components:

1. **Prompts**: These are text-based prompts that can guide a model in transforming a given input text into the desired output format. Each prompt is carefully crafted to ensure it encapsulates the transformation requirement effectively.

2. **Python Code**: This section contains Python scripts and code snippets that programmatically implement the transformation of text. The code provided is versatile and can be customized to suit your specific needs.
